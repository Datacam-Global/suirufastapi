# Azure Web App Deployment Fix

## Current Status: ðŸ”§ Ready for Deployment (Secrets Setup Required)

The FastAPI application deployment has been fixed and is ready to deploy, but requires GitHub secrets to be configured.

## Problem Resolved
The FastAPI application was failing to start on Azure Web App with the error:
```
/opt/python/3/bin/python: No module named uvicorn
Container fastapis_0_bf315f7f for site fastapis has exited, failing site start
```

## Root Cause Identified and Fixed
1. âœ… Dependencies were not being installed properly during Azure Web App deployment
2. âœ… Virtual environment was not being activated correctly in GitHub Actions  
3. âœ… Azure Web App was not configured with proper Python startup commands

## Current Blocking Issue: Missing GitHub Secrets

The GitHub Actions deployment is now failing with:
```
Error: Deployment Failed, Error: No credentials found. Add an Azure login action before this action.
```

**SOLUTION**: You need to set up the `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` secret in your GitHub repository.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Set Up GitHub Secrets (Recommended)
1. **Follow the guide**: See `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
2. **Download publish profile** from Azure Portal for your "fastapis" web app
3. **Add to GitHub secrets** as `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`
4. **Re-run the workflow** in GitHub Actions

### Option 2: Manual Deployment (Immediate Solution)
```bash
# Run the manual deployment script
./manual-deploy-azure.sh
```
This will deploy your application directly to Azure without GitHub Actions.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/azure-webapps-python.yml`)
- Properly activate virtual environment during dependency installation
- Added verification step to ensure uvicorn is installed
- Updated artifact upload to exclude unnecessary virtual environment files
- Added Python setup in deployment step

### 2. Enhanced Startup Script (`startup.sh`)
- Added robust dependency checking and installation
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added Python path configuration
- Used `exec` for proper process management

### 3. Added Azure Configuration Files
- **`.deployment`**: Tells Azure how to deploy the application
- **`web.config`**: IIS configuration for Python applications
- **`.env.azure`**: Azure-specific environment variables
- **`deploy-azure-webapp.sh`**: Deployment script with proper dependency installation

### 4. Updated Requirements (`requirements.txt`)
- Added `gunicorn` for production WSGI server option
- Added `python-multipart` for file upload handling
- Updated `uvicorn[standard]` to include all optional dependencies

## Deployment Process

### Method 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Push changes to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy to Azure
3. Monitor deployment logs in GitHub Actions tab

### Method 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Run the deployment script locally to test
./deploy-azure-webapp.sh

# Or deploy using Azure CLI
az webapp up --name fastapis --resource-group <your-resource-group>
```

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify the application is working:

1. **Check Application Logs**:
   ```bash
   az webapp log tail --name fastapis --resource-group <your-resource-group>
   ```

2. **Test API Endpoints**:
   ```bash
   curl https://fastapis.azurewebsites.net/
   curl https://fastapis.azurewebsites.net/docs
   ```

3. **Verify Dependencies**:
   Access the Kudu console at `https://fastapis.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole` and run:
   ```bash
   python -c "import uvicorn; print(uvicorn.__version__)"
   python -c "import fastapi; print(fastapi.__version__)"
   ```

## Environment Variables in Azure Portal

Set these application settings in your Azure Web App:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT` | `true` |
| `ENABLE_ORYX_BUILD` | `true` |
| `WEBSITE_PYTHON_VERSION` | `3.12` |
| `PYTHONPATH` | `/home/site/wwwroot` |
| `WEBSITE_STARTUP_FILE` | `startup.sh` |

## Troubleshooting

### If the application still fails to start:

1. **Check the logs**:
   ```bash
   az webapp log download --name fastapis --resource-group <your-resource-group>
   ```

2. **Test locally first**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/nyuydine/Documents/Skye8/suirufastapi
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

3. **Verify file structure**:
   Ensure the `app/` directory and `main.py` are in the correct locations

4. **Check Azure Portal**:
   - Go to your Web App in Azure Portal
   - Check "Deployment Center" for build logs
   - Check "Log stream" for runtime logs
